An app that I would love to improve is instagram. While I currently enjoy how the app works, I think that there are several features that can be added to improve uer experience. At the moment, if a user wants to view the earliest posts by another user on their profile, the user has to continuously scroll until the bottom of the posts page. This can be taxing if the profile has a lot of posts say over 50 posts. Therefore, a feature like a button that allows a user to click and instantly go to the earliest posts or be able to sort the way these posts can be viewed on their end from earliest to latest would help solve this problem. Another feature that could be useful is searching through instagram story viewers. If an instagram user posts a story, they can currently only see the number of story viewers and would have to scroll to the bottom if they are searching for one particular viewer. If there was a feature to search through the viewers' list, then it would be easier to do so.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I think the instructions could be more specific especially when adding the logic to the ViewController class.
